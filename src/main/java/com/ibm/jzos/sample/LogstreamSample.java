/**
 * Sample program that uses ZLogstream, supporting IXGCONN (connect) and IXGBRWSE (read), 
 * to read data from a z/OS Logstream (aka, the z/OS System Logger).
 * The name of the z/OS logstream is given as arguments to main(). If a Java security 
 * manager is active, it is used to check permissions for reading or writing to a resource 
 * path name generated from the logstream name. For a logstream named "XXX.YYY.ZZZ", 
 * a pathname of "/LOGSTREAM/XXX/YYY/XXX" is used.
 * <p>
 * Note: 
 * To avoid memory leaks, a ZLogstream instance must be closed at the end of the execution 
 * or when the execution is interrupted by an exception. Refer to the code below for details.
 * </p>
